This repo is for testing the `react-native-enriched-markdown` screen reader support compared to WebView screen reader support.

- build and open the app on a device
- switch on screen reader (VoiceOver / TalkBack)
- navigate to the links
- observe how in the markdown the links do not get individually focused
- observe how in the webview the links do get individually focused
